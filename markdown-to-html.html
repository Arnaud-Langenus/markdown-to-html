    <h4> You can always count on me when</h4>
    <p>  you have a jar of B&J Cookie Dough to trade for my services (or just simply when you ask, I always love to help). <br/>
        I am comfortable working alone, but have no issues, and actually prefer, working in group. I love taking on an issue in <br/>
        a team effort. I also highly value learning from my mistakes, so never be afraid to tell when I do something wrong.</p>

    <h4> A funny story</h4>
    <p>
        When I was in Zimbabwe I went rafting on the Zambezi river. There is a rapid (a sudden increase in water velocity and turbulence) <br/>
        called <a href="https://imgur.com/tcucOPJ"> The Washing Machine </a>, where the raft capsized, and everyone on board got thrown into the coarsing river. Everyone made it <br/>
        back on board apart from, of course, me. A life guard came to save me with his hilariously short 1m long kayak, where I had to grab <br/>
        on like a baby monkey grabs on to the back of his mother. This did not go to plan, because the next great rapid called The Terminator, <br/>
        a humongous torrent the size of the pool of tears I will cry once JavaScript starts, swallowed me whole, and dragged me down to the <br/>
        bottom of the river, where I stayed for exactly 11 seconds. The only proof I have of this adventure is a picture of me on the moment <br/>
        of capsizing, and when my lifeguard decided I wasn't wet enough already (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/pJKgGuq">Proof.</a>).
    </p>

<div>
    <h4> TL;DR </h4>
    <p> I learned that wildwater rafting is not fun if you can't breathe underwater.</p>
